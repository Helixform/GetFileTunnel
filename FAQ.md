# FAQ

## Do I need access to a wireless network?

**FileTunnel** works completely offline, and you don't need any network environment. But you need to connect your device to your Mac with a USB cable.

## Can I send files wirelessly?

Currently, **FileTunnel** doesn't support wireless connections.

## Will the app collect personal data?

No, the app will not send any network requests. Your data is completely processed on-device, and will only be transferred to your computer over the wire.

## How to get faster transfer speed?

Use the highest specification cable compatible with your device, such as [Thunderbolt 4 (USBâ€‘C) Pro Cable](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MWP02AM/A/thunderbolt-4-usb%E2%80%91c-pro-cable-3-m).

## How can I submit a bug?

Just file an issue on GitHub, it's easy.
